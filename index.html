			<h1>Putting Code Into Practice: Freestyle Drones</h1>
			<p>Peanut-butter and jelly, smores, and chicken pad thai are some of the tastiest mashups of somewhat unusual ingredients.
			Slap a high-drain lipo battery on a frame with overpowered motors and a niche-raspberry pi, you have yourself a
			starter platform for a drone. The code is the jelly. Of course, the flight controller must have a gyro for measurements
			and the design must adhere to the current and amperage ratings warrented by the chosen components.
			</p>

			<p>The code for these devices began as a hack of the infamous Nintendo wii controller. Through the power of the internet, 
			the raw code was released into the wild, where anyone could formulate a useage for this peculiar bit of software. The idea
			in special cases was to harness the gyroscope's measurements and pump them though what is called a P.I.D. loop. 
			</p>

			<p>The Proportional Integral and Derivative loop is a series of equations that are notably what allows for fine, servo-like 
			adjustments to be made to the motions of a free-spinning motor, it "smoothens the ride" if you will. P.I.D. loops are 
			used in many pieces of technology -inventions like the hoverboard, or Segway for instance. Drones use the P.I.D. and 
			on-board gyro to tweak the motors (and by extention, the propellars) to steady the vehicle and vary speed while airborne. 
			</p>
		 
			<p>Refinement and innovation took place over many iterations of the software; several development teams accross the globe 
			released versions that had enhancements here or there. Most of these enhancements were performance based. As the craft is
			flying, from cross winds to quick meneuvers on the pilot side, the resultant motor output had to jive and enable
			contiuous, unfaltered flight. As pilots began to get used to the general characteristics of flying a drone, more was left 
			to be desired. The developers caught on quickly and persued to push the hardware to greater limits through additions to 
			the code. 
			</p>

			<p>Currently the P.I.D. loop can be customized, notably called tuning, and is set up to by the piolot as per 
			preference and how their individual drone reacts in flight. There are many other features such as frequencies for the 
			sampling rate from the P.I.D. and things like anti-gravity, which greatly alters the loop at a given moment of high 
			g-force that's exerted on the gyro.
			</p>

			<p>All of these improvements, collectively birthed the freestyle drone that is present today. Thousands of people across 
			the world have taken to the drone in sport or simply as hobby. From the development crews to the community, the draw 
			to this very neat way to apply software to hardware continues to grow exponentially.
